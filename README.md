# Undergraduate-Year-4-Project
Optimising a machine learning compiler (Apache TVM) for heterogenous computers.

The compiler has an auto-tuning feature, meaning that it is able to optimize machine learning models to individual GPUs. The GitHub page for TVM is https://github.com/apache/tvm/.

My project focuses on enlarging the configuration space for the auto-tuner, allowing the compiler to explore more comprehensive settings for the GPU.

The project was done on the CSE department's Linux server at CUHK, which hasn't been available since graduation.
